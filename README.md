# ninja_gold
Create a new Flask project 

Create a template as shown in a wireframe , with 4 separate forms

Have the root route render the wireframed page

Have the "/process_gold" POST route increase/decrease the user's gold by an appropriate amount and redirect to the root route

BONUS: Display all the activities performed by the user in a log on the HTML, as shown in the wireframe

BONUS: Have the activities be color-coded (+ money is green, - money is red)

BONUS: Add a reset button to restart the game

BONUS: Have the activities display in descending order, with the most recent activity first

BONUS: Provide winning parameters to the game--for example, a user must obtain 500 gold in less than 15 moves. Only display the reset button once the user has won or lost.
